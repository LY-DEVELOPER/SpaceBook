# SpaceBook
Social media for astronauts made using react native

Requires Node.js and expo to be installed

To start project open repo directory in cmd and run command "expo start"

This project is following the air bnb style guide
using ESlint to enforce it, however due to some 
conflicts of rules in my code I have had to disable
these rules:

    'linebreak-style': ['error', 'windows'],
    'react/prop-types': 'off',
    'no-use-before-define': ['error', { functions: true, classes: true, variables: false }],
    'react/destructuring-assignment': 'off',
